# SocioBay ðŸ’¬
A **Real-Time** chat application with multiple custom rooms and user sign-up functionalities
1. **Sockets.io** - Used to implement the real-time functionalities by sending triggering and monitoring events on a topic-subscription based model.
2. **ReactJS** - The front end has been built using ReactJs to implement live state-change handling on (send/receive) message events.
## **Live Demo** - Heroku got priced :(
